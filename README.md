# Billiards

This project is based on OpenGL - GLUT, before you run this code you need to make sure you already have the GLUT lib. The [instruction](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/courses/eecs487/glut-howto/) is here. 

If you run it in Windows with Visual Studio, make sure you copy the `include` folder and `lib` folder to your Windows Kits\10\%the version you installed%. Or just add the path to your project properties in Visual Stuido.
